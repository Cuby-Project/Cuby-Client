## Coming in the future

---
This app is still in development, I'm currently working on the statistics sections, I want a page where you can find all the information about your solves with charts. I have just finished the inner modelisation, so now the app is usable, but there is still a lot of progress too, if you have any suggestions fell free to open a pull request or an issue if you find a bug.
